## Hi, I'm Tim 👋

🌍 I like tackling real world problems utilising computational methods.

I am currently working on my master's thesis in safe, differentiable reinforcement learning at

My hubris goal in life is to contribute somewhat significantly to the welfare of humankind. \
Right now, the plan is trying to increase abundance in either 

⚡  **Energy** by Renewables ☀️ or Fusion 🌀 

🛠️  **Labour** by Robotics 🤖

🧠  **Intelligence** by Machine Learning 📈, Societal Simulation 🏙️, or Improved Governance and Long-term decision making 🏛️

As a side I'm into transhumanism 💊, gaming 🎮, and politics 🌻.
